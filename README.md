# Instant-Incognito
Instantly go into incognito mode. Made this since I like making bookmarklets to circumvent evil restrictions placed upon me!

## Explanation
Basically, this bookmarklet embeds your current webpage into an about:blank page that extensions (like Hapara) cannot see. Whatever you do in that embed won't be recorded in your browser history either! I like to use this on [Google](<https://www.google.com/>) so I can quickly search up things on my school laptop without having it be written down in my history â€” forever engraved, for I can't delete it. Sad? If you think so and are suffering from the same thing you can thank me for this execellent tool I made in 15 minutes! I'll probably update it, but don't expect much since I don't want to be a full-time programmer: wasting away staring at my monitor. Even now my legs ache from inactivity, just as my hands hover over my keyboard unable to clench as hard as I could've before starting...

## Instructions
Alright enough with that: go to the 'bookmarklet.js' file, copy everything there, and then paste it into your bookmarks bar. Then click on it on whatever website you're on to use it. Doesn't work on new tab, settings, and other built-in pages. You may also look at the 'code.js' file to see all the code nicely formatted.
